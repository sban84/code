/**
  * Created by suman.banerjee on 4/11/2017.
  *
  * A class for immutable linked lists representing ordered collections of elements of type A.
    This class comes with two implementing case classes scala. and scala.:: that implement the abstract members isEmpty, head and tail.
    This class is optimal for last-in-first-out (LIFO), stack-like access patterns. If you need another access pattern, for example, random access or FIFO, consider using a collection more suited to this than List.

  A ListBuffer is a mutable object (contained in package scala.collection.mutable), which can help you build lists more efficiently
  when you need to append. ListBuffer provides constant time append and prepend operations. You append elements with the += operator, and
  prepend them with the +=: operator. When youâ€™re done building, you can obtain a List by invoking toList on the ListBuffer.
